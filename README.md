reinventing the wheel in javascript

I discovered the flash game (firstpersontetris.com) some time around or after 2009. it is a flash game where instead of the piece rotating and the environment staying still, the environment rotates around the piece. I want to recreate this game in javascript. mostly because i want to be able to play it forever. but partially also because it was built in flash & who knows how long flash will be supported.
